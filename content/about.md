My first vague memory of playing tennis was when a friend and I took a few backyard  badminton rackets to the tennis court, found a couple of old balls lost in the brush behind the fences, and rallied the balls back and forth over the net until the badminton rackets not designed for striking a heavier tennis ball broke.  An inauspicious beginning.

My formal tennis began subsequent to informing my father I wanted to learn how to play tennis. My father (having the mindset of Will Hunting many years prior to the movie) believed anything worth learning can be learned at the public library.

### Playing Career

As a player I played first singles for my high school team for three years recording a record of 66-5 while being a two time New York State Public High School Section V Tournament champion,

My college years saw me playing first singles for the team all four years placing second place in the State University of New Athletic Conference Tournament at both first singles and first doubles during that time.
