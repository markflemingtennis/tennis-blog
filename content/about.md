My formal tennis began subsequent to informing my father I wanted to learn how to play tennis. My father (having the mindset of Will Hunting many years prior to the movie) believed anything worth learning can be learned at the public library.

Fortunately the book he brought home was by Rod Laver who was to win all four Grand Slam majors in the 1969 calendar year for the second time.

An increasing amount of television broadcasts with legendary Bud Collins enabled me to regularly study, learn, and visualize from the tennis games of two of the top professional players of the time, 1969 Wimbledon finalists Rod Laver and John Newcombe.

On January 9, 1971 I was also able to see my first live professional tennis match featuring Rod Laver and John Newcombe. The Rochester War Memorial where I was one of 5200 spectators featured these two players in the 1971 Tennis Champions Classic, a series of winner take all matches.

### Playing Career

As a player I played first singles for my high school team for three years recording a record of 66-5 while being a two time New York State Public High School Section V Tournament champion,

My college years saw me playing first singles for the team all four years placing second place in the State University of New Athletic Conference Tournament at both first singles and first doubles during that time.
