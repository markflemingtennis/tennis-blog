My formal tennis began subsequent to informing my father my father I wanted to learn how to learn to play tennis and he having the mindset of Will Hunting many years prior to the movie anything worth learning can be learned at the library brought me home a book.

Fortunately the book he brought home was a book by Rod Laver who was to win all four Grand Slam majors that calendar year for the second time.

As a player I played first singles for my high school team for three years recording a record of 66-5 while being a two time New York State Public High School Section V Tournament champion,

My college years saw me playing first singles for the team all four years placing second place in the State University of New Athletic Conference Tournament at both first singles and first doubles during that time.
