A common perception among players at all levels is pure raw power wins tennis matches.

Power is a wonderful ability to have.

However, when we are playing at the baseline and are either 1) unable to control our power, or 2) the opponent is not effected by our power, what are some strategies or patterns we can utilize?

## Hit The Ball In The Court

* An initial strategy in gaining tennis competency is to consistently stroke as many shots in-a-row as you are capable of.
* Making more overall shots than your opponent will result in success for you in points, sets, and matches.

## Hit To The Opponent's Weakness

* As a player progresses or is facing an opponent with the ability to keep as many shots in play as they can, additional tactics should be employed.
* Such a second strategy is to assess and direct shots toward the opponent's stroke weakness.
* Directing the shot to the other player's backhand is the first stroke to attempt to attack with this being the weakness among a majority of players.

## Hit The Ball Crosscourt

* As individuals progress up the tennis ladder and find themselves competing against players with both sound forehands and backhands further patterns become necessary.
* Understanding tennis court geometry can be a great advantage in taking charge of point play.  Measurements of the court are: 1) straight ahead from baseline to baseline is 78 feet, and 2) diagonally from your corner to the opposing corner is 82.5 feet.
* Hitting the ball crosscourt allows you to gain two tactical advantages by: 1) maximizing your "margin of error" to the longer 82.5 foot court and 2) moving your opponent.    

## Keep The Ball Out Of The Opponent's Strike Zone

* Most players generally have their preferred power zone or "strike zone" between chest and knee level.
*  In situations where your opponent is outmaneuvering or overpowering you from the baseline a smart tactic is to not let them contact the ball in their preferred strike zone.

Use underspin to have the ball skid lower than their desired strike zone.

Hit a looping shot preferably with topspin to create a bounce which will be higher than than their desired strike zone.

## Move Your Opponent Using The Entire Court

court by mixing higher deeper balls with shorter balls (drop shots that bring the opponent into the net).

Options here could include the following combinations:

1\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot for a winner.

2\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to draw the opponent into the net and then pass them.

3\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to bring the opponent in then lob over them.
