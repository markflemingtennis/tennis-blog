A common perception among players at all levels is that pure raw power wins tennis matches.

Power is a wonderful ability to have.

However, when we are playing at the baseline and are either 1) unable to control our power, or 2) the opponent is not effected by our power, what are some strategies or patterns we should utilize?

## Hit The Ball In The Court

* An initial strategy in gaining tennis competency is to consistently stroke as many shots in-a-row as you capable of making.
* The result of making more overall shots than your opponent will result in success for you within a point, a set, and a match.

## Hit To The Opponent's Weakness

* As we progress or are facing and opponent with the ability to keep as many shots in play as we can, a second strategy is to assess the opponent's weakness and direct our shots there.
* (As you progress hit your forehand to their backhand).

## Hit The Ball Crosscourt

to maximize your margin for error and to move your opponent.

## Keep The Ball Out Of The Opponent's Strike Zone

Use underspin to have the ball skid lower than their desired strike zone.

Hit a looping shot preferably with topspin to create a bounce which will be higher than than their desired strike zone.

## Move Your Opponent Using The Entire Court

court by mixing higher deeper balls with shorter balls (drop shots that bring the opponent into the net).

Options here could include the following combinations:

1\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot for a winner.

2\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to draw the opponent into the net and then pass them.

3\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to bring the opponent in then lob over them.
