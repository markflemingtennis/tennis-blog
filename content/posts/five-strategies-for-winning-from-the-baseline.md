A common perception among players at all levels is that pure raw power wins tennis matches.

Power is a wonderful ability to have.

However, when we are unable to control every shot we hit from the baseline what are some strategies or patterns we should utilize?

## Hit The Ball In The Court

## Hit To The Opponent's Weakness

(As you progress hit your forehand to their backhand).

## Hit The Ball Crosscourt 

to maximize your margin for error and to move your opponent.

## Keep The Ball Out Of The Opponent's Strike Zone 

Use underspin to have the ball skid lower than their desired strike zone.

 Hit a looping shot preferably with topspin to create a bounce which will be higher than than their desired strike zone.

## Move Your Opponent Using The Entire Court  

court by mixing higher deeper balls with shorter balls (drop shots that bring the opponent into the net).

Options here could include the following combinations:

1\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot for a winner.

2\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to draw the opponent into the net and then pass them.

3\. Mix a high deep ball with a drop shot to bring the opponent in then lob over them.
