In doubles players frequently find themselves in one up and one back situation.

When doubles teams are in this formation, and the opponents lob over the net person's head, what are the players' resulting responsibilities?

To assist players in visualizing their responsibilities in this situation it is helpful to refer to the game of football.

In football, quarterbacks such as perennial NFL MVP candidate Aaron Rodgers initial task is to view and read the opponents defensive sets in front of him.

If the opposing teams defensive formation are counter to the originally called play he must communicate through audibles, adjustments which are necessitated by the manner in which opponents have lined up.

Likewise, in tennis doubles where teammates are in a one up and one back situation, the player in the back like the quarterback, sees the court better and must instruct the player at the net what they need to do.

* Subsequent to lob clearing the the net player's head the the person in the back should begin running to the ball while simultaneously yelling loud enough for their partner to hear "I got it switch".
* In a situation where your lob is short or 2 people are up you need to yell to your partner to get back so they won't get killed
* 
* I got it switch
* In more advanced doubles may also have to communicate get back and to up

## Conclusion

Master being your doubles team's quarterback in the one up and one back formation by successfully reading the situation on the court in the point, and communicating through an audible to your partner what they need to do.
