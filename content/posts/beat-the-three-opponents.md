Each of us has opponents who consistently frustrate us on the tennis courts.

In reality, most of us will never have the opportunity to compete against the best of the best such as Roger, Rafa, Novak, Serena, Vicka, or Naomi.

However, whether you are playing against players at the Hall of Fame, advanced, intermediate, or novice levels there are mindsets and technical fundamentals which can assist you in achieving greater levels of success.

From a psychological standpoint we should strive to eliminate our focus on the personality of the individual on the other side of the court, and instead focus on from a technical standpoint overcoming three opponents to make ourselves better players.

## OPPONENT ONE: HIT THE BALL

Our first opponent to overcome is hitting the ball.

Three key components to improve in hitting the ball include:

### 1. Prepare to Hit The Ball

* Physically prepare by getting in the ready position with the weight of your body on the balls of your feet ready to move.
* Mentally prepare by not just being physically ready, but just as or more importantly watching the ball leave your opponent’s racket after they have made contact to start your response.

### 2. Get To The Ball

* Initiate your movement by pushing off with a reaction step immediately as you identify the direction your opponent’s shot is traveling.
* Run with your racket prepared.
* Utilize longer running strides to get to balls which are a greater distance away.
* Desire to make every effort to arrive at the anticipated ball bounce area either as, or shortly after it crosses the net to your side depending on the speed of the incoming shot .
* Incorporate shorter steps, shuffling, or a combination of both to reach balls closer to you.
* Conclude your stroke preparation by incorporating short adjustment steps to get yourself in the best position with the best possible balance to hit the best possible shot you are capable of in the given situation.

### 3. Watch The Ball

To control your ensuing shot the ultimate goal is to make an effort to watch the ball in a manner to allow you to hit the ball in the center of the racket, it's "sweet spot".  

The techniques to attempt to master in watching the ball include:

* Watch the ball leave your opponent's racket as described above.
* Track the ball as it crosses the net and approaches you.
* Keep your head down and make every attempt to see the ball contact the racket in the "sweet spot".
* Avoid mishitting the ball by looking up too soon, by keeping your head down and watching the contact point for a split second after contact, then looking up.

## OPPONENT TWO: BEAT THE NET

The second opponent to overcome is the net.

A commonly held principle is 70% of points in tennis are scored by one player committing an error.

Of those errors 70% result by one of the competitors hitting the ball into the net.

Reason then suggests if we can continually improve our ability to hit all of our shots over the net more regularly we will grow as players.

Three key components of beating the net include:

* Backswing below the ball
* Clear the net  by three to five feet

## OPPONENT THREE: BEAT THE LINES

In the fifty years of playing, teaching, and coaching tennis players often comment they have worked diligently on their strokes but don't seem to be able to control the ball by frequently hitting the ball either long or wide of the court. 

* Beginner low smooth follow through
* Advanced Player Topspin
* Focal Point give yourself a margin of error 

## CONCLUSION

Many people subsequent to being unsuccessful in a tennis match lament they beat themselves and their opponent did not beat them.

In reality, however, our first responsibility is, to the best of our ability, continually strive to successfully beat the: 1) ball, 2) net, and 3) lines.

Only then do we need to worry regarding the individual we are opposing.
